### 1. Complete Metadata

- Phase, time estimate, difficulty
- Prerequisites and dependencies
- Project thread (component evolution)
- Correctness properties

### 2. Verification Section

- 3-5 automated test scripts
- Expected output examples
- Clear pass/fail criteria
- Runnable without modifications

### 3. Summary Section

- Minimum 7 bullet points
- Key takeaway statement
- Skills unlocked
- Looking ahead connector

### 4. Hands-On Exercises

- Minimum 2 "Try This!" exercises
- Progressive difficulty
- Hints and solutions provided

## 🧪 Testing Requirements

### Property-Based Tests

Use Hypothesis for testing:

```python
from hypothesis import given, strategies as st

@given(st.text())
def test_property(input_text):
    result = process(input_text)
    assert isinstance(result, str)
```

### Verification Scripts

Each chapter needs verification scripts:

```python
# verify_chapter_XX.py
def verify_implementation():
    """Test the chapter's main concepts."""
    # Test code here
    print("✅ All verifications passed!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    verify_implementation()
```

## 🎨 Code Style

### Python

- Follow PEP 8
- Use type hints
- Document with docstrings
- Keep functions focused

### Markdown

- Use clear headings
- Include code blocks with language tags
- Add emoji for visual clarity (sparingly)
- Keep lines under 120 characters
