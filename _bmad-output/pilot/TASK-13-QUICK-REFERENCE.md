# Task 13: Quick Reference Card

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE (Documentation Phase)
**Next**: Execute after Task 12 completes

---

## 📋 What Is Task 13?

**Iteration based on feedback** - Improve pilot chapters based on student testing results

**Goal**: Achieve 80%+ completion rate before scaling to 48+ chapters

**Duration**: 4-6 hours dev time + 1 week re-test time

| Document                          | Purpose                   | When to Use          |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------- |
| `TASK-13-README.md`               | Overview and guide        | Start here           |
| `TASK-13-IMPLEMENTATION-GUIDE.md` | Step-by-step instructions | During execution     |
| `retrospective.md`                | Document iteration work   | Fill in as you go    |
| `SIMULATED-FEEDBACK-SCENARIO.md`  | Example feedback          | Study before Task 12 |
| `TASK-13-COMPLETION-SUMMARY.md`   | Deliverables overview     | Quick status check   |

## 🔄 Workflow

```
1. ANALYZE (1-2h)
   └─ Review feedback → Identify issues → Prioritize fixes

2. IMPROVE (2-3h)
   └─ Update hints → Fix templates → Adjust tiers

3. VALIDATE (1 week)
   └─ Re-convert → Re-test → Measure improvement

4. DOCUMENT (30min)
   └─ Complete retrospective → Make gate decision
```

## ✅ Success Criteria

**PASS** (Proceed to scale):

- Overall completion rate ≥80%
- Improved by ≥5%
- Stuck points reduced ≥30%
- Hint quality ≥0.80
- Positive feedback

**CONDITIONAL PASS** (Discuss):

- Completion rate 75-79%
- Most criteria met
- Minor issues remain

**FAIL** (Iterate again):

- Completion rate <75%
- Major issues found
- Max 2 iterations

## 🎯 Common Improvements

Based on simulation, expect to:

1. **Add Missing Hints**:
   - Retry logic patterns
   - Mathematical formulas
   - System architecture
   - Code patterns

2. **Clarify Vague Hints**:
   - Be more specific
   - Add examples
   - Explain patterns

3. **Adjust Tiers**:
   - Add more guidance if needed
   - Keep what works

## 📊 Expected Impact

| Metric          | Before | After | Change |
| --------------- | ------ | ----- | ------ |
| Completion Rate | 76%    | 85%+  | +9%    |
| Stuck Points    | 8      | 2-3   | -60%   |
| Hint Quality    | 0.78   | 0.85+ | +0.07  |

## 🚀 Quick Start

### When Task 12 Completes:

1. **Open**: `TASK-13-IMPLEMENTATION-GUIDE.md`
2. **Follow**: Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3 → Phase 4
3. **Document**: Fill in `retrospective.md` as you go
4. **Decide**: Make gate decision at end

### If Already ≥80%:

1. **Skip**: Iteration not needed
2. **Document**: Success in retrospective
3. **Proceed**: Directly to Task 14

- **Template Structure**: See `retrospective.md`
- **Overview**: See `TASK-13-README.md`

---

## ⏱️ Timeline

- **Analysis**: 1-2 hours
- **Improvement**: 2-3 hours
- **Re-Conversion**: 1 hour
- **Re-Testing**: 1 week (tester time)
- **Documentation**: 30 minutes

**Total**: ~1-2 weeks (including re-test)

## 🎓 Key Lessons (from simulation)

1. Complex concepts need explicit guidance
2. Vague hints don't help students
3. Architectural diagrams are valuable
4. Formulas and patterns should be explicit
5. Tier assumptions may need adjustment
