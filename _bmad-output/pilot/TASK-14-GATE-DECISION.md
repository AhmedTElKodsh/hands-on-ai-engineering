## Gate Score Calculation

```
Criterion 1 (Student Success):     [PASS / FAIL]
Criterion 2 (Quality Metrics):     [PASS / FAIL]
Criterion 3 (Student Feedback):    [PASS / FAIL]
Criterion 4 (Improvements):        [PASS / FAIL / N/A]
Criterion 5 (Documentation):       [PASS / FAIL]

Total Criteria Met: [X] / 5
Gate Score: [Y]%

Decision Threshold:
- 100% (5/5) = PASS
- 80-99% (4/5) = CONDITIONAL PASS
- <80% (≤3/5) = FAIL
```
