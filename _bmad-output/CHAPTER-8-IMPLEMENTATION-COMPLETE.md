## LESSONS LEARNED

**What Worked Well:**

- War stories provide compelling real-world context
- Analogies make abstract patterns accessible
- Metacognitive prompts encourage deep reflection
- Error prediction exercises build debugging skills
- Confidence calibration promotes accurate self-assessment
- Coding challenge reinforces learning through practice

**Key Insights:**

- Abstraction is insurance (pay 0.1% upfront to avoid 300% cost later)
- Vendor lock-in can kill companies ($60K refactoring cost)
- Redundancy pays for itself (one outage justifies years of investment)
- Factory methods centralize logic and enable flexibility
- Multi-provider isn't optional for production systems
