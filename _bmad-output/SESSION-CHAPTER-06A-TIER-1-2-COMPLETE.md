## 📝 Implementation Notes

### What Worked Well

- Systematic approach with detailed plan
- Clear location identification before implementation
- Efficient use of strReplace tool
- Analogies are varied and relatable
- War stories provide real-world context
- Metacognitive prompts encourage reflection

### Challenges Encountered

- Some text matching required exact formatting (italics, spacing)
- Had to use grepSearch to find exact text patterns
- File was initially truncated, required multiple reads

### Lessons Learned

- Always verify exact text before strReplace
- Use grepSearch for precise location finding
- Read complete file in chunks for large files
- Document progress incrementally

## 🎓 Educational Impact

### Pedagogical Principles Applied

From the 23-principle framework:

**Tier 1 Principles**:

1. ✅ Metacognitive Prompts (Principle 16)
2. ✅ Error Prediction Exercises (Principle 17)
3. ✅ Real-World War Stories (Principle 18)
4. ✅ Confidence Calibration Checks (Principle 19)

**Tier 2 Principles**: 5. ✅ Spaced Repetition Callbacks (Principle 20) 6. ✅ Graduated Scaffolding with Explicit Fade (Principle 21) 7. ✅ Enhanced Analogies (Principle 13 - expanded from 3-4 to 7)
