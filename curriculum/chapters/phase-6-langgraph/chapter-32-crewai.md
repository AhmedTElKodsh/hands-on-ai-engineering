## ☕ Coffee Shop Intro

**Imagine this**: You want to start a magazine.
**Option A (LangGraph)**: You build the office. You wire the phones. You write the employee handbook. You manually tell the Writer when to talk to the Editor. (Powerful, but lots of work).
**Option B (CrewAI)**: You hire a "Magazine-in-a-Box". You just say "I need a Writer and an Editor", and the system handles the desks, the phones, and the meetings.

**CrewAI** is a high-level framework built *on top* of LangChain.
It abstracts away the graph building. You just define **Roles** and **Tasks**, and CrewAI figures out how to make them work together.

**By the end of this chapter**, you will spin up a full content marketing agency in about 30 lines of code. 🏢

---

## Prerequisites Check

We need the CrewAI library.

```bash
pip install crewai
```

---

## The Story: The "Context" Bucket-Brigade

### The Problem (Manual Passing)

In Chapter 43, we manually passed `messages` from Researcher to Writer.
`writer_node` had to look at `state["messages"][-1]`.
If we added a third agent ("Editor"), we'd have to rewrite the Writer to pass to Editor. It's brittle.

### The Solution (Automatic Delegation)

In CrewAI, Task 2 *automatically* gets the output of Task 1 as context.
You don't wire anything. You just list the tasks in order.
Researcher -> (Context) -> Writer -> (Context) -> Editor.

---

## Part 1: The Agents (The Roleplay)

CrewAI agents need a **Backstory**. The more detail you give, the better they act.

### 🔬 Try This! (Hands-On Practice #1)

**Create `agents.py`**:

```python
from crewai import Agent
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
import os

# We need to set the model explicitly to use OpenAI
# (CrewAI defaults to OpenAI, but explicit is better)
llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini")

# 1. The Researcher
researcher = Agent(
    role='Senior Research Analyst',
    goal='Uncover cutting-edge developments in AI',
    backstory="""You work at a leading tech think tank.
    Your expertise lies in identifying emerging trends.
    You have a knack for dissecting complex data and presenting actionable insights.""",
    verbose=True,
    allow_delegation=False,
    llm=llm
)

# 2. The Writer
writer = Agent(
    role='Tech Content Strategist',
    goal='Craft compelling content on tech advancements',
    backstory="""You are a renowned Content Strategist, known for your insightful and engaging articles.
    You transform complex concepts into compelling narratives.""",
    verbose=True,
    allow_delegation=False,
    llm=llm
)

print("Agents created!")
```

---

## Part 2: The Tasks (The Job Description)

A Task needs a **Description**, an **Expected Output**, and an **Agent** to do it.

### 🔬 Try This! (Hands-On Practice #2)

**Create `tasks.py`**:

```python
from crewai import Task
from agents import researcher, writer

# Task 1: Research
task1 = Task(
    description="""Conduct a comprehensive analysis of the latest advancements in AI Agents in 2024.
    Identify key trends, breakthrough technologies, and potential industry impacts.""",
    expected_output="Full analysis report in bullet points",
    agent=researcher
)

# Task 2: Write
# Notice: We don't manually pass Task 1's output. CrewAI does it.
task2 = Task(
    description="""Using the insights provided, develop an engaging blog post for Medium.
    The post should be fun, accessible, and informative.""",
    expected_output="Full blog post of at least 3 paragraphs",
    agent=writer
)

print("Tasks defined!")
```

---

## Part 3: The Crew (The Team)

Now we instantiate the Crew and say "Go".

### 🔬 Try This! (Hands-On Practice #3)

**Create `run_crew.py`**:

```python
from crewai import Crew, Process
from agents import researcher, writer
from tasks import task1, task2

# 1. Assemble Crew
crew = Crew(
    agents=[researcher, writer],
    tasks=[task1, task2],
    verbose=True, # Shows the "Thinking" process
    process=Process.sequential # Run Task 1, then Task 2
)

# 2. Kickoff
print("---" + "-" * 10 + " Starting Crew " + "-" * 10 + "---")
result = crew.kickoff()

print("\n\n########################")
print("## Here is the result ##")
print("########################\n")
print(result)
```

**Run it**.
Watch the console.
1. Researcher starts.
2. Output is generated.
3. Writer starts (using Researcher's output).
4. Final blog post is printed.

Zero graph code. Zero state management. It just works.

---

## Part 4: Using Tools (Giving them Power)

CrewAI agents can use LangChain tools!

### 🔬 Try This! (Hands-On Practice #4)

Let's give the researcher a "Calculator" (simulated).

**Create `tool_crew.py`**:

```python
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew
from langchain_community.tools import tool

@tool("Calculator")
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Adds two numbers."""
    return a + b

# Agent with Tools
math_agent = Agent(
    role="Mathematician",
    goal="Solve math problems",
    backstory="You love numbers.",
    tools=[add],
    verbose=True,
    llm="gpt-4o-mini"
)

task = Task(
    description="What is 55 + 123?",
    expected_output="The sum",
    agent=math_agent
)

crew = Crew(agents=[math_agent], tasks=[task])
result = crew.kickoff()
print(f"Result: {result}")
```

**Run it**.
The agent will see the tool, call it, and report the answer.

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake #1: Using Local LLMs without Configuration
CrewAI defaults to OpenAI. If you want to use Ollama, you must configure `llm=Ollama(...)` or set `OPENAI_API_BASE`.

### Mistake #2: Vague "Expected Output"
CrewAI uses the "Expected Output" string to self-reflect ("Did I finish?"). If you say "Do your best", it might loop or stop early. Be specific: "A list of 5 bullet points."

### Mistake #3: Too many agents
If you have 10 agents, the context window fills up fast (Task 10 sees output of Tasks 1-9).
**Fix**: Break into smaller Crews.

---

## Quick Reference Card

### Crew Template

```python
crew = Crew(
    agents=[agent1, agent2],
    tasks=[task1, task2],
    process=Process.sequential
)
result = crew.kickoff()
```

---

## Verification (REQUIRED SECTION)

We need to verify **P61 (Assignment)** and **P62 (Order)**.

**Create `verify_crew.py`**:

```python
"""
Verification script for Chapter 44.
Properties: P61 (Assignment), P62 (Order).
"""
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew, Process
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
import sys

print("🧪 Running CrewAI Verification...\n")

llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini", temperature=0)

# Track execution
execution_log = []

# Mock Agent Logic (We can't easily mock internal CrewAI logic, 
# so we rely on the output to prove execution order)

agent1 = Agent(role="A", goal="Say A", backstory="I say A", llm=llm)
agent2 = Agent(role="B", goal="Say B", backstory="I say B", llm=llm)

task1 = Task(
    description="Return the letter 'A' and nothing else.",
    expected_output="A",
    agent=agent1
)

task2 = Task(
    description="Return the letter 'B' and nothing else.",
    expected_output="B",
    agent=agent2
)

crew = Crew(
    agents=[agent1, agent2],
    tasks=[task1, task2],
    process=Process.sequential
)

res = crew.kickoff()

# Verification
# Note: CrewAI kickoff returns the *final* task output.
# To verify order, we rely on the concept that Task 2 (B) ran last.
print(f"Final Result: {res}")

if "B" in str(res):
    print("✅ P62 Passed: Task 2 executed last (Sequential order respected).")
else:
    print(f"❌ Failed: Unexpected final result {res}")
    sys.exit(1)

# P61: Task Assignment validity is implicit if the correct agents ran.
# In a real test, we'd spy on the agent calls. 
# For now, if the result is correct, the agents did their job.
print("✅ P61 Passed: Agents executed their assigned tasks.")

print("\n🎉 Chapter 44 Complete! You are a Crew Commander.")
```

**Run it:** `python verify_crew.py`

## Summary

**What you learned:**

1. ✅ **CrewAI Framework**: A high-level abstraction for Agents.
2. ✅ **Role-Playing**: Why `backstory` improves performance.
3. ✅ **Context Passing**: How CrewAI automatically chains outputs.
4. ✅ **Process Management**: Sequential vs Hierarchical (Manager).
5. ✅ **Rapid Prototyping**: Building complex flows in minutes.

**Key Takeaway**: Use LangGraph when you need *precise control* (ifs, loops, interrupts). Use CrewAI when you need a *creative team* to just get the job done.

**Skills unlocked**: 🎯
- Team Management
- High-Level Orchestration
- rapid Agent Deployment

**Looking ahead**: We've done strict graphs (LangGraph) and creative teams (CrewAI).
What if we want agents that can **Code** and **Converse** in a loop until they solve a hard problem?
In **Chapter 45**, we will explore **AutoGen** (Microsoft's framework) for iterative conversation patterns!
