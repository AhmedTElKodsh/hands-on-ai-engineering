## Introduction

**The moment of truth has arrived.**

You've spent weeks learning Python, mastering error handling, and understanding configuration management. Now you're about to cross the threshold that separates traditional software engineers from AI engineers.

**Here's what's at stake:**

Your civil engineering firm just landed a $2M contract to analyze 10,000 historical building inspection reports. The client needs:

- Summaries of each report (10,000 summaries)
- Risk assessments for structural issues
- Compliance checks against current building codes
- All delivered in 3 months

**Your options:**

**Option A: Manual Analysis**

- Hire 5 engineers at $100/hour
- Each report takes 2 hours to analyze
- Total: 10,000 reports × 2 hours × $100 = **$2,000,000**
- Timeline: 10,000 hours / (5 engineers × 160 hours/month) = **12.5 months**
- **Result:** Project fails (over budget, over timeline)

**Option B: LLM-Powered Analysis**

- Build an automated system (1 week of engineering)
- Cost per report: ~$0.50 (API costs)
- Total: 10,000 reports × $0.50 = **$5,000**
- Timeline: **1 week to build + 1 day to process**
- **Result:** Project succeeds with 99.75% cost savings

**This chapter teaches you Option B.**

By the end, you'll have built the foundational component of a production-ready document analysis system: a reliable, interactive LLM client that can:

- Authenticate securely with API providers
- Handle errors gracefully (rate limits, network failures)
- Manage conversation state (the #1 gotcha in chatbot development)
- Process documents efficiently (token-aware design)

**This isn't a toy project.** The patterns you learn here are used by companies processing millions of documents daily. You're building real infrastructure.

**The transition you're making:**

- **Before:** You wrote code that follows deterministic rules
- **After:** You'll engineer systems that leverage probabilistic reasoning

This shift requires understanding not just API syntax, but the fundamental concepts of tokens, roles, and state management. These aren't implementation details—they're the core of AI engineering.

**Let's build something that matters.** 🚀

## Spaced Repetition: Quick Review

**Before we dive into LLMs, let's refresh key concepts from previous chapters:**

**From Chapter 1 (Environment Setup):**

- Q: How do you securely store API keys?
- A: In `.env` files using environment variables, never hardcoded

**From Chapter 6B (Error Handling):**

- Q: What's the difference between `try/except` and `try/except/finally`?
- A: `finally` always executes, even if an exception occurs

**From Chapter 3 (Pydantic):**

- Q: Why use Pydantic models instead of dictionaries?
- A: Type validation, automatic documentation, and error prevention

**If any of these feel shaky, take 5 minutes to review those chapters now!**

## Prerequisites Check

Before we dive in, let's make sure your "programming utility belt" is stocked with the tools we need.

✅ **Error handling** (Chapter 6B):
You should be comfortable wrapping risky code in `try/except` blocks.

```python
try:
    result = risky_operation()
except SpecificError as e:
    logger.error(f"Operation failed: {e}")
```

✅ **Environment variables** (Chapter 1):
We never hardcode secrets! You should know how to read from `.env` files.

```python
import os
api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY") # We'll need this!
```

✅ **Installing packages** with pip:
You'll need to install the OpenAI library.

```bash
pip install openai python-dotenv
```

✅ **Basic dictionaries and JSON** (Chapter 2):
Our messages to the AI will be structured as dictionaries.

```python
request = {
    "model": "gpt-4",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
}
```

Everything look good? Great. Let's start building! 🧩

## ☕ Coffee Shop Intro

Imagine the first time you ever sent a text message or an email. You typed a message, hit send, and then waited with anticipation for a reply. It was a simple action, but it connected you to another person somewhere else in the world. 📱

**Today, you're about to experience something even more magical.**

You're not just sending a message to another person who might reply when they're free. You're about to open a direct line of communication with one of the most powerful artificial intelligences in existence. You'll send a message to an AI model, and it will respond—not with pre-programmed answers like an old-school chatbot, but with _generated intelligence_.

Think about what this means: you can ask it to explain complex physics, write poetry, debug your code, or brainstorm ideas for a structural engineering project, and it will reason through your request in real-time. You aren't just writing code anymore; you're orchestrating a conversation with a system that has read almost the entire internet.

**Here's the promise**: By the end of this chapter, you won't just understand "how to use an API." You'll have built your own working chatbot that you can talk to right from your terminal. You'll understand exactly how tokens work, how to handle errors gracefully, and how to control the "creativity" of the AI's responses.

**Here's a sneak peek at what you'll build:**

```python
# In just a few lines of code, you'll do this:
response = llm.chat("Explain quantum computing to a 5-year-old")
print(response)

# Output: "Imagine you have a magical box that can try every possible solution
#          to a puzzle at the same time..."
```

This is the moment your Python code starts talking back. Let's make your first LLM call! 🚀

## What You Already Know 🧩

You might feel like "AI Engineering" is a completely new field, but the truth is, you've been using the core technology behind it for years without realizing it.

**Think about your daily digital life:**

When you check the weather app on your phone, your app sends a request to a server asking, "What's the weather in Cairo?" The server replies, `{"temp": 25, "condition": "sunny"}`.

When you post on social media, your app sends your text to a server: "Here is my status update." The server replies, `{"status": "posted", "likes": 0}`.

**LLM APIs work effectively the same way:**

1.  **You send a request**: Instead of asking for weather, you send a prompt: "Write a poem about concrete."
2.  **The Server processes it**: Instead of looking up a database, a massive neural network "thinks" about your prompt.
3.  **You receive a response**: The server sends back the generated text.

**Analogy: The Post Office** 📬

LLM API calls are like sending letters through the post office:

- You write a letter (request payload with your prompt)
- The post office processes it (inference on massive GPU clusters)
- You receive a reply letter (response with generated text)
- **Critical insight:** The post office has no memory of previous letters you sent (stateless!)

The only difference from traditional APIs is the _intelligence_ of the processing. Instead of just fetching data, you're tapping into a system that can create, reason, and analyze. But structurally? It's just an API call. You've got this! 🤯

---

## Part 1: Anatomy of an LLM API

### The Request-Response Cycle

Unlike traditional APIs that return structured data (like a JSON list of users), LLM APIs generate unstructured text based on probabilistic prediction. However, the mechanism of interaction remains a standard HTTP Request-Response cycle.

1.  **Request**: You send a payload containing the model configuration (temperature, max tokens) and a list of messages (the conversation history).
2.  **Inference**: The provider (e.g., OpenAI) processes this context token-by-token.
3.  **Response**: The provider returns a JSON object containing the generated text choice(s) and usage metadata.

### What Actually Happens?

When we talk about an "LLM API," we're talking about a service that lets you send text to a model hosted on a massive server farm (likely using thousands of GPUs) and get a response back.

**Analogy: The Restaurant Kitchen** 🍽️

Think of an LLM API like ordering from a high-end restaurant:

- **You (The Client Code)**: You assume the role of the customer. You have a specific craving (your prompt).
- **The Waiter (The API)**: You can't just walk into the kitchen. You hand your order to the waiter. The waiter ensures your order is formatted correctly and authenticated (you can pay).
- **The Kitchen (The Model)**: Inside the kitchen, a team of expert chefs (the Neural Network) works together to craft your dish. They verify ingredients, mix flavors, and plate it up.
- **The Dish (The Response)**: The waiter brings back your meal. It's unique every time—even if you order the same item twice, the garnish might be slightly different (Temperature/Randomness).

### Major Providers

There are several "Kitchens" you can order from. Here are the big ones you'll encounter:

| Provider      | Popular Models          | Best For                                                   |
| ------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **OpenAI**    | GPT-4o, GPT-3.5-Turbo   | General reasoning, coding, instruction following.          |
| **Anthropic** | Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Opus | Complex analysis, creative writing, large context windows. |
| **Google**    | Gemini 1.5 Pro/Flash    | Processing huge documents, video, and images.              |
| **Meta**      | Llama 3                 | Open-source models you can run on your own hardware.       |

For this chapter, we'll use **OpenAI**, as they have the most standard API format. But don't worry—the concepts you learn here transfer to _all_ of them.

### Understanding Tokens: The "Lego Bricks" of AI 🪙

If you take nothing else from this chapter, **remember this: Tokens are NOT words.**

This is the single most common misconception for new AI engineers. When you send text to an LLM, it doesn't read "words" like you do. It breaks text down into "tokens."

**Analogy: Lego Bricks vs. Completed Toys** 🧱

Imagine you're buying a Lego set.

- A "word" is like a completed toy structure.
- A "token" is the individual Lego brick.

Some words are simple and made of one brick (token). Other words are complex and made of 3 or 4 bricks.

**Analogy: Currency Exchange** 💱

Tokens are like foreign currency when traveling:

- You exchange dollars for tokens (pay for input)
- You exchange tokens back for dollars (pay for output)
- Exchange rates vary (different models have different prices)
- You have a wallet limit (context window - can't carry infinite tokens)

**The Rule of Thumb:**

- 1 Token ≈ 4 Characters of English text.
- 1 Token ≈ ¾ of a word.
- 100 Tokens ≈ 75 Words.

**Why does this matter?**

1.  **Cost**: You pay per token. "Hello" (1 token) is cheaper than "Congratulations" (3 tokens).
2.  **Memory**: Models have a "Context Window limit." GPT-4 might hold 128,000 tokens. If you try to send a book that is 200,000 tokens long, it will fail (or "truncate" the text).
3.  **Latency**: Output tokens are generated sequentially. A longer response takes linearly longer to arrive.

---

### 🧠 Metacognitive Checkpoint: Token Economics

**Pause and reflect:**

You've just learned that tokens are the "currency" of LLMs—you pay for both input and output, and there's a hard limit on context window size.

**Think about these scenarios:**

**Scenario A:** You're building a document summarizer. A user uploads a 50-page engineering report (≈25,000 tokens). Your system needs to:

1. Send the entire document to the LLM
2. Ask for a summary
3. The LLM generates a 500-token summary

**Scenario B:** You're building a chatbot. A user has a 20-message conversation (≈5,000 tokens of history). They ask a new question.

**Questions to consider:**

- In Scenario A, what's the approximate cost if input tokens cost $0.01/1K and output tokens cost $0.03/1K?
- In Scenario B, do you need to send all 20 previous messages every time? What if the conversation reaches 100 messages?
- What happens when the conversation history exceeds the model's context window (e.g., 4,096 tokens)?
- How would you design a system that balances cost, latency, and conversation quality?

<details>
<summary>💡 <strong>Reflection Guide</strong></summary>

**Scenario A - Cost Calculation:**

- Input: 25,000 tokens (document) + 50 tokens (prompt) = 25,050 tokens
- Output: 500 tokens (summary)
- Cost: (25.05 × $0.01) + (0.5 × $0.03) = $0.25 + $0.015 = **$0.265 per summary**

**Key insight:** Long documents are expensive! If 1,000 users summarize documents daily, that's $265/day = $8,000/month.

**Scenario B - Context Window Management:**

- **Naive approach:** Send all 20 messages every time
  - Problem: At 100 messages, you hit the context limit
  - Problem: Cost scales linearly with conversation length
  - Problem: Latency increases (more tokens to process)

**Better approaches:**

1. **Sliding window:** Keep only the last N messages (e.g., last 10)
2. **Summarization:** Periodically summarize old messages, keep summary + recent messages
3. **Relevance filtering:** Only include messages relevant to the current question

**Real-world example:**
ChatGPT uses a combination of these strategies. It doesn't send your entire conversation history every time—it intelligently manages context.

**Design trade-offs:**

- **Send everything:** Perfect memory, but expensive and slow
- **Send nothing:** Cheap and fast, but no context
- **Send smartly:** Balance cost, speed, and quality

**Key lesson:** Token management is a core engineering challenge in LLM systems. Every token you send costs money and time. Design your system to be token-efficient!

**Production pattern:**

```python
def manage_context(messages, max_tokens=3000):
    """Keep conversation within token budget"""
    total_tokens = sum(estimate_tokens(msg) for msg in messages)

    if total_tokens <= max_tokens:
        return messages  # All good

    # Strategy: Keep system message + last N messages
    system_msg = messages[0]
    recent_messages = messages[-10:]  # Last 10 messages

    return [system_msg] + recent_messages
```

</details>

**Action:** Before moving on, estimate the token cost for YOUR use case. If you're building a chatbot, how long can conversations get before you need context management?

### ⚠️ War Story: The $15,000 Token Bill

**Real incident from a legal tech startup (2023)**

**The Setup:**

A startup built a legal document analysis tool. Users could upload contracts and ask questions about them. Simple, right?

**Their implementation:**

```python
def analyze_document(document_text, user_question):
    messages = [
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a legal analyst."},
        {"role": "user", "content": f"Document:\n{document_text}\n\nQuestion: {user_question}"}
    ]
    response = openai.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        messages=messages
    )
    return response.choices[0].message.content
```

**Looks fine, right?**

**The Disaster:**

A law firm uploaded a 200-page merger agreement (≈100,000 tokens) and asked 50 questions about it.

**What happened:**

- Each question sent the ENTIRE 100,000-token document
- 50 questions × 100,000 tokens = 5,000,000 input tokens
- GPT-4 pricing (at the time): $0.03/1K input tokens
- Cost: 5,000 × $0.03 = **$150 for ONE user session**

**The startup had 100 beta users. In one week:**

- Total cost: **$15,000**
- Monthly projection: **$60,000**
- Their entire seed funding: **$100,000**

**They were burning through their runway at 60% per month on API costs alone.**

**The Root Cause:**

They didn't understand token economics. They treated the LLM like a database—send the full document every time.

**The Fix:**

They implemented a three-tier strategy:

**Strategy 1: Chunking + Semantic Search**

```python
# Split document into chunks
chunks = split_document(document_text, chunk_size=1000)

# Embed chunks (one-time cost)
embeddings = embed_chunks(chunks)

# For each question, find relevant chunks
def analyze_document(document_chunks, embeddings, user_question):
    # Find top 3 relevant chunks (semantic search)
    relevant_chunks = find_relevant(user_question, embeddings, top_k=3)

    # Send only relevant chunks (3,000 tokens instead of 100,000!)
    context = "\n\n".join(relevant_chunks)
    messages = [
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a legal analyst."},
        {"role": "user", "content": f"Context:\n{context}\n\nQuestion: {user_question}"}
    ]
    response = openai.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        messages=messages
    )
    return response.choices[0].message.content
```

**Cost reduction:** 100,000 tokens → 3,000 tokens = **97% cost savings**

**Strategy 2: Caching**

```python
# Cache document analysis
cache = {}

def analyze_document_cached(document_id, user_question):
    # Check if we've seen this document before
    if document_id not in cache:
        cache[document_id] = {
            "chunks": split_document(...),
            "embeddings": embed_chunks(...)
        }

    # Reuse cached chunks and embeddings
    return analyze_document(
        cache[document_id]["chunks"],
        cache[document_id]["embeddings"],
        user_question
    )
```

**Strategy 3: Model Selection**

```python
# Use cheaper models for simple questions
def analyze_document_smart(document_chunks, user_question):
    # Classify question complexity
    if is_simple_question(user_question):
        model = "gpt-3.5-turbo"  # $0.001/1K tokens
    else:
        model = "gpt-4"  # $0.03/1K tokens

    # ... rest of the logic
```

**Results After Optimization:**

- Cost per user session: $150 → **$5** (97% reduction)
- Monthly API costs: $60,000 → **$2,000**
- Runway extended: 1.6 months → **50 months**

**Lessons Learned:**

1. **Token economics matter** — Every token costs money and time
2. **Don't send full documents** — Use chunking + semantic search
3. **Cache expensive operations** — Embeddings, summaries, etc.
4. **Choose models wisely** — GPT-4 for complex, GPT-3.5 for simple
5. **Monitor costs in real-time** — Set up alerts before disaster strikes

**The startup's new rule:** "Every engineer must estimate token costs before deploying a feature."

**Your takeaway:** Before you send a 50-page document to an LLM, ask: "Do I really need to send ALL of this?" The answer is almost always "No." Use RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) patterns—we'll cover this in Chapter 17!

**Token efficiency is not optional—it's survival.** 💰

## Part 2: Security First (The Gymnasium Analogy) 🔑

Before we write code, we need an **API Key**.

**Analogy: The Exclusive Gym Membership**

An API Key is exactly like a membership card for an exclusive, expensive gym.

- **Access**: You need to swipe it to get in. No card, no entry.
- **Billing**: Every time you swipe, the gym tracks exactly who you are. If you use the premium massage chair (GPT-4), they charge your account.
- **Privacy**: **You would never, ever give your gym card to a stranger.**

If you posted your gym card on a billboard (GitHub), anyone could walk in, order 500 smoothies, and stick you with the bill.

**So, repeat after me:**

> "I will NEVER commit my API key to code."

**The Correct Way:**
We store keys in a secret file called `.env` (environment variables) that never gets shared.

```python
# .env file (This stays on your computer!)
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-123456789...
```

---

## Part 3: Your First Python Call 🚀

Let's build it! We'll start with the absolute simplest possible call.

### Step 1: Install Libraries

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
pip install openai python-dotenv
```

### Step 2: The "Hello World" of AI

Create a file called `first_call.py`.

```python
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from openai import OpenAI

# 1. Load the secret .env file
# This looks for a file named ".env" and loads the variables inside it.
load_dotenv()

# 2. Initialize the Client
# We get the key securely. If this is None, OpenAI() will raise an error.
api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
client = OpenAI(api_key=api_key)

print("✅ Authentication successful! Client initialized.")

# 3. Use the Chat Completion API
# We ask the model (gpt-3.5-turbo) to say hello.
print("📡 Sending request to OpenAI...")

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",  # Using the faster, cheaper model for testing
    messages=[
        # The 'user' role represents YOU, the human.
        {"role": "user", "content": "Say 'Hello, AI Agent!' in French."}
    ]
)

# 4. Extract the Message
# The response is a complex object. We need to dig into it to find the text.
reply = response.choices[0].message.content

print(f"🤖 AI Response: {reply}")
```

**Run it:**

```bash
python first_call.py
```

**Expected Output:**

```
✅ Authentication successful! Client initialized.
📡 Sending request to OpenAI...
🤖 AI Response: Bonjour, Agent IA!
```

**🎉 CONGRATULATIONS!** You just orchestrated your first AI interaction.

---

### Step 3: Understanding Roles (System vs. User)

LLM conversations are like a play script. There are three main characters:

1.  **System**: The Director. Sets the scene and personality.
2.  **User**: The Actor. Asks questions or gives orders.
3.  **Assistant**: The AI Actor. Responds to the User.

**Analogy: The Movie Director** 🎬

Message roles are like a film set:

- **System = Director**: Sets the tone, style, and constraints for the entire production
- **User = Actor asking for direction**: "How should I play this scene?"
- **Assistant = Actor performing the scene**: Delivers lines based on director's guidance
- The director's instructions shape every performance—change the director, change the movie

Let's see how changing the **System** role changes the entire vibe.

```python
messages = [
    # The 'system' message tells the AI HOW to behave.
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a grumpy, sarcastic robot from the year 3000."},

    # The 'user' message is what we actually want to ask.
    {"role": "user", "content": "What is 2 + 2?"}
]

response = client.chat.completions.create(model="gpt-3.5-turbo", messages=messages)
print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

**Output:**

> "Oh, brilliant query, Einstein. It's 4. I traversed 50 galaxies to answer a preschool math problem. Any other brain-busters?"

**See the power?** You didn't change the model; you changed the _context_. This is the essence of **Prompt Engineering**.

---

### 🧠 Metacognitive Checkpoint: The Power of System Prompts

**Pause and reflect:**

You've learned that the System message is "god mode"—it shapes the assistant's behavior, tone, and constraints.

**Consider these two system prompts:**

**System Prompt A:**

```
You are a helpful assistant.
```

**System Prompt B:**

```
You are a Senior Civil Engineering Consultant with 20 years of experience in structural design and building codes.

Your responses must:
- Use precise technical terminology (e.g., "moment-resisting frame" not "strong structure")
- Cite relevant building codes (IBC, ASCE 7) when applicable
- Prioritize safety and regulatory compliance
- Be concise (max 3 paragraphs unless asked for detail)
- Flag any assumptions you make about the project context

If a question is outside your domain (e.g., electrical systems), say: "This is outside my structural engineering expertise. Consult a licensed electrical engineer."
```

**Questions to consider:**

- If a user asks "How do I build a strong foundation?", how would the responses differ?
- Which prompt is more likely to give dangerous advice?
- Which prompt is more expensive (hint: longer prompts = more input tokens)?
- How specific should you make your system prompt?

<details>
<summary>💡 <strong>Reflection Guide</strong></summary>

**Response Comparison:**

**With Prompt A:**

> "To build a strong foundation, use concrete and rebar. Make sure it's deep enough and level."

**Problems:**

- Vague ("deep enough" - how deep?)
- No safety considerations
- No code references
- Could lead to structural failure

**With Prompt B:**

> "Foundation design depends on soil bearing capacity, structural loads, and local seismic requirements per IBC Section 1810. For a typical residential structure:
>
> 1. Conduct soil testing (ASTM D1586) to determine bearing capacity
> 2. Calculate dead + live loads per ASCE 7
> 3. Design footing dimensions: Width = Total Load / Allowable Soil Pressure
>
> Assumption: I'm assuming residential construction. For commercial/industrial, consult a licensed structural engineer and conduct site-specific geotechnical analysis."

**Key differences:**

- ✅ Specific technical terms
- ✅ Code references
- ✅ Safety-first approach
- ✅ Flags assumptions
- ✅ Knows its limits

**The Cost Trade-off:**

- Prompt A: ~10 tokens
- Prompt B: ~150 tokens
- Cost difference: ~$0.0015 per request (negligible!)
- Value difference: Potentially prevents structural failure (priceless!)

**How specific should you be?**

**Too vague:**

```
You are helpful.
```

Result: Generic, potentially dangerous advice

**Just right:**

```
You are a [specific role] with [specific expertise].
Follow these rules: [specific constraints].
```

Result: Reliable, domain-appropriate responses

**Too specific:**

```
You are John Smith, born in 1975, who graduated from MIT in 1997, worked at...
[500 tokens of backstory]
```

Result: Expensive, no quality improvement

**Real-world pattern:**

```python
SYSTEM_PROMPTS = {
    "civil_engineer": """You are a Senior Civil Engineering Consultant...""",
    "code_reviewer": """You are a senior software engineer reviewing code...""",
    "technical_writer": """You are a technical documentation specialist..."""
}

def create_chat(role="civil_engineer"):
    return [{"role": "system", "content": SYSTEM_PROMPTS[role]}]
```

**Key lesson:** System prompts are your primary control mechanism. Invest time in crafting them—they shape every response. A well-designed system prompt is worth 100 lines of post-processing code!

**Production tip:** Version your system prompts and A/B test them. Track which prompts produce better responses for your use case.

</details>

**Action:** Write a system prompt for YOUR use case. Be specific about role, constraints, and output format. Test it with edge cases!

## 🔬 Try This! (Practice #1)

Now it's your turn to experiment.

**Context**: You've seen how to make a basic call. Now let's try to make the AI useful for a specific domain.

**Challenge**: Write a script that asks the user for a topic, and then generates a haiku (3 lines, 5-7-5 syllables) about that topic using the `gpt-3.5-turbo` model.

**Requirements**:

1.  Use `input()` to get a topic from the keyboard.
2.  Set the `system` role to "You are a poetic assistant."
3.  Print the result cleanly.

**Starter Code**:

```python
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from openai import OpenAI

load_dotenv()
client = OpenAI(api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"))

topic = input("Enter a topic for a Haiku: ")

# TODO: Create your list of messages
# messages = ...

# TODO: Call the API
# response = ...

# TODO: Print the content
```

<details>
<summary>💡 Hint (click if you need help)</summary>

**Level 1 Hint**: You need a list of dictionaries. One for system, one for user.
**Level 2 Hint**: `messages = [{"role": "system", "content": "..."}, {"role": "user", "content": f"Write a haiku about {topic}"}]`

</details>

<details>
<summary>✅ Solution (check after you try!)</summary>

```python
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from openai import OpenAI

load_dotenv()
client = OpenAI(api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"))

topic = input("Enter a topic for a Haiku: ")

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a poetic assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": f"Write a haiku about {topic}"}
    ]
)

print("\n🌿 Your Haiku:")
print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

</details>

## Part 4: Building a "Memory" (Stateful Chatbot)

You might have noticed something. If you run the code twice, the AI handles each run separately. It doesn't "remember" you.

**The API is Stateless.**
This means every time you call it, it's like meeting for the first time. It has complete amnesia.

**Analogy: The Amnesia Patient** 🧠

Stateless APIs are like talking to someone with complete amnesia:

- They forget everything after each conversation ends
- You must remind them of all previous context
- You're the memory keeper (state manager)
- Without your notes (message history), they can't maintain continuity

To build a chatbot, **WE** (the developer) must handle the memory. We do this by keeping a list of all messages and sending the _entire list_ back to the API every time.

**Analogy: The Scroll** 📜
Imagine communicating with a king via scroll.

1.  You write "Hello" on the scroll and send it.
2.  The king reads "Hello", writes "Greetings", and sends it back.
3.  You write "How are you?" on the _same scroll_ (below his reply) and send it.
4.  The king reads the _whole scroll_ ("Hello", "Greetings", "How are you?") and responds.

If you sent a _fresh_ scroll with just "How are you?", the king would say "Who are you?"

### The Chatbot Code

Let's build `simple_chat.py`:

```python
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from openai import OpenAI

load_dotenv()
client = OpenAI(api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"))

# 1. Initialize the conversation history (The Scroll)
history = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."}
]

print("💬 Chatbot initialized. Type 'exit' to quit.")

while True:
    # 2. Get user input
    user_input = input("\nYou: ")

    if user_input.lower() == "exit":
        print("Goodbye!")
        break

    # 3. Add USER message to history
    history.append({"role": "user", "content": user_input})

    # 4. Send the WHOLE history to the API
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
        messages=history
    )

    # 5. Get the reply
    reply = response.choices[0].message.content
    print(f"AI: {reply}")

    # 6. CRITICAL: Add AI message to history!
    # If we forget this, the AI will forget what it just said.
    history.append({"role": "assistant", "content": reply})
```

**Try running this.** Ask it "My name is Ahmed." Then ask "What is my name?" It will remember!

---

### 🧠 Metacognitive Checkpoint: Statelessness & Memory

**Pause and reflect:**

You've learned that LLM APIs are **completely stateless**—they have zero memory between requests. You must manually manage conversation history.

**Think about this conversation:**

```
Turn 1:
User: "I'm working on a bridge project in California."
Assistant: "Great! California follows Caltrans standards..."

Turn 2:
User: "What seismic requirements apply?"
```

**Questions to consider:**

- If you only send Turn 2's message, will the assistant know about the bridge project?
- If you send both Turn 1 and Turn 2, what's the token cost?
- What if the conversation has 50 turns? Do you send all 50 every time?
- How is this different from a traditional database-backed chat application?

<details>
<summary>💡 <strong>Reflection Guide</strong></summary>

**Stateless vs Stateful Systems:**

**Traditional Chat (Stateful):**

```python
# Server maintains state
class ChatServer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.conversations = {}  # Stored in memory/database

    def send_message(self, user_id, message):
        history = self.conversations[user_id]  # Retrieve history
        response = generate_response(message, history)
        history.append(response)  # Update history
        return response
```

**LLM Chat (Stateless):**

```python
# YOU maintain state
class LLMChat:
    def __init__(self):
        self.messages = []  # YOU store this

    def send_message(self, message):
        self.messages.append({"role": "user", "content": message})

        # Send ENTIRE history every time
        response = openai.chat.completions.create(
            model="gpt-4",
            messages=self.messages  # Full history
        )

        # YOU must append the response
        self.messages.append({
            "role": "assistant",
            "content": response.choices[0].message.content
        })
        return response
```

**Key differences:**

| Aspect            | Traditional Chat       | LLM Chat                   |
| ----------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **State storage** | Server-side            | Client-side (your code)    |
| **Memory**        | Persistent (database)  | Ephemeral (your variable)  |
| **Cost**          | Fixed (database query) | Scales with history length |
| **Context**       | Unlimited              | Limited by context window  |

**The Turn 2 Problem:**

**If you only send Turn 2:**

```python
messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "What seismic requirements apply?"}
]
```

Response: "I need more context. What type of structure and location?"

**If you send both turns:**

```python
messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "I'm working on a bridge project in California."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Great! California follows Caltrans standards..."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "What seismic requirements apply?"}
]
```

Response: "For bridge projects in California, seismic design must follow Caltrans Seismic Design Criteria..."

**The 50-Turn Problem:**

**Naive approach (send everything):**

- Turn 50: Send all 50 previous messages
- Token cost: ~10,000 tokens
- Latency: ~5 seconds
- Cost: ~$0.10 per message

**Smart approach (context management):**

```python
def get_relevant_context(messages, current_question, max_tokens=2000):
    """Keep only relevant history"""
    # Strategy 1: Sliding window (last N messages)
    recent = messages[-10:]

    # Strategy 2: Semantic search (find relevant past messages)
    relevant = find_similar_messages(messages, current_question, top_k=5)

    # Strategy 3: Summarization (summarize old messages)
    if len(messages) > 20:
        old_summary = summarize(messages[:-10])
        return [old_summary] + recent

    return recent
```

**Real-world example:**

**ChatGPT's approach:**

1. Keeps recent messages (sliding window)
2. Summarizes very old conversations
3. Has a hard limit (e.g., 8K tokens for GPT-4)
4. When limit is reached, drops oldest messages

**Your responsibility as an engineer:**

- ✅ Store conversation history (in memory, database, or file)
- ✅ Decide what to send (all history vs. relevant context)
- ✅ Manage token budget (don't exceed context window)
- ✅ Handle edge cases (what if history is too long?)

**Key lesson:** Statelessness means YOU are the memory system. Design your context management strategy based on your use case—don't blindly send everything!

**Production pattern:**

```python
class ConversationManager:
    def __init__(self, max_context_tokens=3000):
        self.messages = []
        self.max_tokens = max_context_tokens

    def add_message(self, role, content):
        self.messages.append({"role": role, "content": content})
        self._trim_context()  # Keep within budget

    def _trim_context(self):
        """Keep conversation within token budget"""
        while self._estimate_tokens() > self.max_tokens:
            # Remove oldest user-assistant pair (keep system message)
            if len(self.messages) > 3:
                self.messages.pop(1)  # Remove oldest user message
                self.messages.pop(1)  # Remove oldest assistant message
            else:
                break

    def get_messages(self):
        return self.messages
```

</details>

**Action:** Design a context management strategy for a 100-turn conversation. How would you keep it under 4,000 tokens while maintaining conversation quality?

### ⚠️ War Story: The Chatbot That Forgot Everything

**Real incident from a healthcare AI company (2022)**

**The Setup:**

A company built a medical symptom checker chatbot. Patients would describe symptoms, and the bot would ask follow-up questions to narrow down potential conditions.

**Their implementation:**

```python
@app.route("/chat", methods=["POST"])
def chat_endpoint():
    user_message = request.json["message"]

    # Create new conversation every time!
    messages = [
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a medical assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": user_message}
    ]

    response = openai.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        messages=messages
    )

    return {"response": response.choices[0].message.content}
```

**The Disaster:**

**Conversation 1:**

- Patient: "I have a headache and fever."
- Bot: "How long have you had these symptoms?"
- Patient: "Three days."
- Bot: "I don't have enough information. Can you describe your symptoms?"

**Wait, what?** The bot just asked about duration, then forgot it asked!

**Conversation 2:**

- Patient: "I'm allergic to penicillin."
- Bot: "Noted. What are your symptoms?"
- Patient: "Sore throat and cough."
- Bot: "I recommend amoxicillin." (a penicillin-based antibiotic!)

**This is dangerous.** The bot forgot the allergy information.

**The Root Cause:**

They treated each HTTP request as independent. No state management. Every message was a brand new conversation.

**What the bot saw:**

```
Request 1: "I have a headache and fever."
Request 2: "Three days."  # No context!
Request 3: "I'm allergic to penicillin."
Request 4: "Sore throat and cough."  # Forgot allergy!
```

**The Impact:**

- Beta testers reported "the bot is stupid"
- Medical advisors flagged safety concerns
- Launch delayed by 3 months
- Had to rebuild entire conversation system
- Estimated cost: **$1.2M in lost revenue and engineering time**

**The Fix:**

They implemented proper state management with session storage:

```python
# Store conversations in database
conversations = {}  # In production: use Redis or database

@app.route("/chat", methods=["POST"])
def chat_endpoint():
    user_id = request.json["user_id"]
    user_message = request.json["message"]

    # Retrieve or create conversation history
    if user_id not in conversations:
        conversations[user_id] = [
            {"role": "system", "content": "You are a medical assistant."}
        ]

    messages = conversations[user_id]

    # Append user message
    messages.append({"role": "user", "content": user_message})

    # Get response
    response = openai.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        messages=messages
    )

    assistant_message = response.choices[0].message.content

    # Append assistant message (CRITICAL!)
    messages.append({"role": "assistant", "content": assistant_message})

    # Save updated conversation
    conversations[user_id] = messages

    return {"response": assistant_message}

@app.route("/chat/reset", methods=["POST"])
def reset_conversation():
    """Allow users to start fresh"""
    user_id = request.json["user_id"]
    if user_id in conversations:
        del conversations[user_id]
    return {"status": "reset"}
```

**Production-Grade Implementation:**

```python
from redis import Redis
import json

redis_client = Redis(host='localhost', port=6379, db=0)

class ConversationManager:
    def __init__(self, user_id, system_prompt):
        self.user_id = user_id
        self.system_prompt = system_prompt
        self.key = f"conversation:{user_id}"

    def get_messages(self):
        """Retrieve conversation from Redis"""
        data = redis_client.get(self.key)
        if data:
            return json.loads(data)
        else:
            # New conversation
            return [{"role": "system", "content": self.system_prompt}]

    def add_message(self, role, content):
        """Add message and save to Redis"""
        messages = self.get_messages()
        messages.append({"role": role, "content": content})

        # Save with 24-hour expiration
        redis_client.setex(
            self.key,
            86400,  # 24 hours
            json.dumps(messages)
        )

        return messages

    def reset(self):
        """Clear conversation history"""
        redis_client.delete(self.key)

# Usage
@app.route("/chat", methods=["POST"])
def chat_endpoint():
    user_id = request.json["user_id"]
    user_message = request.json["message"]

    # Manage conversation state
    conv = ConversationManager(user_id, "You are a medical assistant.")
    messages = conv.add_message("user", user_message)

    # Get response
    response = openai.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        messages=messages
    )

    assistant_message = response.choices[0].message.content
    conv.add_message("assistant", assistant_message)

    return {"response": assistant_message}
```

**Lessons Learned:**

1. **HTTP is stateless, but conversations aren't** — You must persist state
2. **Use session storage** — Redis, database, or in-memory cache
3. **Include user IDs** — Track conversations per user
4. **Set expiration** — Don't store conversations forever (privacy + cost)
5. **Test conversation flow** — Verify context is maintained across requests

**The company's new rule:** "Every chatbot feature must pass the 'memory test'—ask a question, then reference it 5 messages later."

**Your takeaway:** Statelessness is the #1 gotcha in LLM applications. The API doesn't remember anything—YOU must build the memory system. In production, this means databases, caching, and careful state management.

**State Management Checklist:**

✅ **DO:**

- Store conversation history per user
- Use persistent storage (Redis, database)
- Append both user and assistant messages
- Set reasonable expiration times
- Provide a "reset conversation" option

❌ **DON'T:**

- Recreate messages list on every request
- Store state only in memory (server restarts = data loss)
- Forget to append assistant responses
- Keep conversations forever (privacy risk)
- Mix up conversations between users

**Remember:** A chatbot without memory is just a fancy random response generator. State management is what makes it feel intelligent! 🧠

## Part 5: Handling Errors Like a Pro 🛡️

In the real world, APIs fail. The internet goes down. You run out of API credits. Users type weird things. A crash in production is a nightmare.

Let's look at the **Retry Pattern** (from Chapter 6B).

```python
from openai import RateLimitError, APIConnectionError
import time

def safe_chat(history):
    # Try 3 times before giving up
    for attempt in range(3):
        try:
            return client.chat.completions.create(
                model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
                messages=history
            )
        except RateLimitError:
            # This happens if we send requests too fast
            print("⏳ Rate limit hit. Waiting 2 seconds...")
            time.sleep(2)
        except APIConnectionError:
            print("⚠️ Internet connection failed. Checking cables...")
            return None
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"❌ Unexpected error: {e}")
            return None

    print("❌ Failed after 3 attempts.")
    return None
```

**Why this matters**: Robustness.
If your app is summarizing 1000 documents and fails on document #999, you don't want the whole program to crash. You want it to wait, retry, and keep going.

### 🔍 Error Prediction Challenge: API Authentication Pitfalls

**Test your understanding!** Predict what happens when this code runs:

```python
import os
from openai import OpenAI

# Case 1: Missing API key
client1 = OpenAI(api_key="")
response1 = client1.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}]
)

# Case 2: Invalid API key format
client2 = OpenAI(api_key="my-secret-key-123")
response2 = client2.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}]
)

# Case 3: API key from environment (but env var not set)
client3 = OpenAI()  # Defaults to os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"]
response3 = client3.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}]
)

# Case 4: Valid key but wrong model name
client4 = OpenAI(api_key="sk-valid-key-here")
response4 = client4.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-99-ultra",  # Doesn't exist
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}]
)
```

**Before running, predict:**

1. Does Case 1 raise an error? At what point (client creation or API call)?
2. Does Case 2 raise an error? What type?
3. Does Case 3 raise an error? What type?
4. Does Case 4 raise an error? What type?

<details>
<summary>🎯 <strong>Answer & Explanation</strong></summary>

**Results:**

**Case 1: Empty API Key**

- ❌ **Error at API call:** `AuthenticationError: Incorrect API key provided`
- **Why:** Client creation succeeds (no validation), but API call fails

**Case 2: Invalid Format**

- ❌ **Error at API call:** `AuthenticationError: Incorrect API key provided`
- **Why:** OpenAI keys start with `sk-`. Invalid format is rejected by API

**Case 3: Missing Environment Variable**

- ❌ **Error at client creation:** `OpenAIError: The api_key client option must be set`
- **Why:** When no key is provided, library checks `OPENAI_API_KEY` env var. If missing, fails immediately

**Case 4: Invalid Model**

- ❌ **Error at API call:** `NotFoundError: The model 'gpt-99-ultra' does not exist`
- **Why:** Client creation succeeds, but API rejects unknown model

**Key Lessons:**

**1. Client creation ≠ Validation**

```python
# This succeeds even with invalid key!
client = OpenAI(api_key="invalid")

# Error happens here
response = client.chat.completions.create(...)  # ❌ AuthenticationError
```

**2. Environment variables are checked at client creation**

```python
# If OPENAI_API_KEY not set, this fails immediately
client = OpenAI()  # ❌ OpenAIError

# Explicit key bypasses env var check
client = OpenAI(api_key="sk-...")  # ✅ Works
```

**3. Model validation happens server-side**

```python
# No local validation of model names
client.chat.completions.create(model="fake-model", ...)  # ❌ NotFoundError
```

**Production-Ready Error Handling:**

```python
from openai import OpenAI, AuthenticationError, NotFoundError, RateLimitError
import os
import sys

def create_safe_client():
    """Create OpenAI client with proper error handling"""
    api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")

    if not api_key:
        print("❌ Error: OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable not set")
        print("Set it with: export OPENAI_API_KEY='sk-...'")
        sys.exit(1)

    if not api_key.startswith("sk-"):
        print("❌ Error: Invalid API key format (should start with 'sk-')")
        sys.exit(1)

    try:
        client = OpenAI(api_key=api_key)
        # Test with a minimal call
        client.models.list()  # Validates authentication
        return client
    except AuthenticationError:
        print("❌ Error: Invalid API key (authentication failed)")
        sys.exit(1)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"❌ Error creating client: {e}")
        sys.exit(1)

def safe_completion(client, model, messages):
    """Make API call with comprehensive error handling"""
    try:
        response = client.chat.completions.create(
            model=model,
            messages=messages
        )
        return response

    except AuthenticationError:
        print("❌ Authentication failed. Check your API key.")
        return None

    except NotFoundError as e:
        print(f"❌ Model not found: {model}")
        print("Available models: gpt-4, gpt-3.5-turbo, gpt-4-turbo")
        return None

    except RateLimitError:
        print("❌ Rate limit exceeded. Wait and retry.")
        return None

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"❌ Unexpected error: {e}")
        return None

# Usage
client = create_safe_client()
response = safe_completion(
    client,
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}]
)

if response:
    print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

**Common Mistakes:**

**❌ Mistake 1: Hardcoding API keys**

```python
client = OpenAI(api_key="sk-abc123...")  # NEVER do this!
```

**✅ Fix:** Use environment variables

**❌ Mistake 2: No error handling**

```python
response = client.chat.completions.create(...)  # Crashes on any error
```

**✅ Fix:** Wrap in try/except

**❌ Mistake 3: Generic exception catching**

```python
try:
    response = client.chat.completions.create(...)
except Exception:
    print("Something went wrong")  # Too vague!
```

**✅ Fix:** Catch specific exceptions and provide actionable messages

**Key takeaway:** API errors happen in production. Handle them gracefully with specific error types and helpful messages. Test your error handling by intentionally triggering each error type!

</details>

**Try it yourself:** Intentionally trigger each error type to see the exact error messages. Understanding errors helps you handle them correctly!

# Forgot to append response!

user_input_2 = "What is my name?"
messages.append({"role": "user", "content": user_input_2})
response_2 = client.chat.completions.create(model="gpt-3.5-turbo", messages=messages)
print(response_2.choices[0].message.content)

# Case 2: Appending wrong role
messages = [{"role": "system", "content": "You are helpful."}]

user_input = "Hello"
messages.append({"role": "user", "content": user_input})
response = client.chat.completions.create(model="gpt-3.5-turbo", messages=messages)

# Oops! Appending as "user" instead of "assistant"
messages.append({"role": "user", "content": response.choices[0].message.content})

# Case 3: Not storing messages at all
def chat(user_input):
    messages = [
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are helpful."},
        {"role": "user", "content": user_input}
    ]
    response = client.chat.completions.create(model="gpt-3.5-turbo", messages=messages)
    return response.choices[0].message.content

print(chat("My name is Ahmed."))
print(chat("What is my name?"))
```

**Before running, predict:**

1. In Case 1, will the model remember Ahmed's name in the second request?
2. In Case 2, what happens when you have two consecutive "user" messages?
3. In Case 3, will the second call remember the first conversation?

<details>
<summary>🎯 <strong>Answer & Explanation</strong></summary>

**Results:**

**Case 1: Forgotten Assistant Response**

- ❌ **Model doesn't remember the name**
- **What the model sees on request 2:**
  ```python
  [
      {"role": "system", "content": "You are helpful."},
      {"role": "user", "content": "My name is Ahmed."},
      {"role": "user", "content": "What is my name?"}
  ]
  ```
- **Problem:** Two consecutive user messages with no assistant response in between
- **Model's response:** "I don't know your name. You haven't told me."

**Why this happens:**
The model has no record of its previous response ("Nice to meet you, Ahmed!"). From its perspective, the user said "My name is Ahmed" but the assistant never acknowledged it.

**Case 2: Wrong Role**

- ⚠️ **May work but violates conversation structure**
- **What the model sees:**
  ```python
  [
      {"role": "system", "content": "You are helpful."},
      {"role": "user", "content": "Hello"},
      {"role": "user", "content": "Hello! How can I help you?"}  # Wrong role!
  ]
  ```
- **Problem:** The assistant's response is labeled as "user"
- **Result:** Model gets confused—it thinks the user said both messages

**Case 3: No State Storage**

- ❌ **Each call is completely independent**
- **What happens:**
  - First call: "My name is Ahmed." → "Nice to meet you, Ahmed!"
  - Second call: "What is my name?" → "I don't know your name."
- **Problem:** `messages` list is recreated on every call—no persistence

**The Correct Implementation:**

```python
from openai import OpenAI

class Chatbot:
    def __init__(self, system_prompt="You are a helpful assistant."):
        self.client = OpenAI()
        self.messages = [{"role": "system", "content": system_prompt}]

    def chat(self, user_input):
        """Send message and maintain conversation state"""
        # 1. Append user message
        self.messages.append({"role": "user", "content": user_input})

        # 2. Get response
        response = self.client.chat.completions.create(
            model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
            messages=self.messages
        )

        # 3. Extract assistant message
        assistant_message = response.choices[0].message.content

        # 4. Append assistant message (CRITICAL!)
        self.messages.append({"role": "assistant", "content": assistant_message})

        return assistant_message

    def get_history(self):
        """View conversation history"""
        return self.messages

# Usage
bot = Chatbot()

print(bot.chat("My name is Ahmed."))
# "Nice to meet you, Ahmed!"

print(bot.chat("What is my name?"))
# "Your name is Ahmed."

# Verify state
print(bot.get_history())
# [
#     {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
#     {"role": "user", "content": "My name is Ahmed."},
#     {"role": "assistant", "content": "Nice to meet you, Ahmed!"},
#     {"role": "user", "content": "What is my name?"},
#     {"role": "assistant", "content": "Your name is Ahmed."}
# ]
```

**State Management Checklist:**

✅ **DO:**

1. Store messages in a persistent list (instance variable or database)
2. Append user message before API call
3. Append assistant message after API call
4. Use correct roles ("user" for user, "assistant" for assistant)
5. Include system message at the start

❌ **DON'T:**

1. Recreate messages list on every call
2. Forget to append assistant responses
3. Mix up roles (user vs assistant)
4. Modify messages after sending (breaks conversation flow)

**Common Bugs:**

**Bug 1: Forgetting to append**

```python
# ❌ Wrong
messages.append({"role": "user", "content": user_input})
response = client.chat.completions.create(...)
# Forgot to append response!

# ✅ Correct
messages.append({"role": "user", "content": user_input})
response = client.chat.completions.create(...)
messages.append({"role": "assistant", "content": response.choices[0].message.content})
```

**Bug 2: Appending wrong content**

```python
# ❌ Wrong
messages.append({"role": "assistant", "content": response})  # Appending entire object!

# ✅ Correct
messages.append({"role": "assistant", "content": response.choices[0].message.content})
```

**Bug 3: Not persisting state**

```python
# ❌ Wrong
def chat(user_input):
    messages = [...]  # Recreated every time!

# ✅ Correct
class Chatbot:
    def __init__(self):
        self.messages = [...]  # Persisted across calls
```

**Debugging Tip:**

Add logging to see exactly what's being sent:

```python
def chat(self, user_input):
    self.messages.append({"role": "user", "content": user_input})

    # Debug: Print what we're sending
    print("=== Sending to API ===")
    for msg in self.messages:
        print(f"{msg['role']}: {msg['content'][:50]}...")

    response = self.client.chat.completions.create(...)
    assistant_message = response.choices[0].message.content
    self.messages.append({"role": "assistant", "content": assistant_message})

    return assistant_message
```

**Key takeaway:** State management is YOUR responsibility. The API is stateless—it only knows what you send. Forget to append a message? The model forgets that part of the conversation. This is the #1 bug in chatbot implementations!

</details>

**Try it yourself:** Implement a chatbot with intentional state bugs, then fix them. Understanding these bugs prevents them in production!

## Project Thread: The Civil Engineering Chatbot

Now we will start building the **CE Document Summarizer**. Our first step is creating the interface that allows an engineer to query the system.

**Objective:** Build an interactive CLI loop that acts as a domain-specific assistant.

**Specifications:**

1.  **System Persona**: Define a System Message that instructs the model to act as a "Senior Civil Engineering Consultant." It should use professional terminology and prioritize safety and regulations in its answers.
2.  **Conversation Loop**: Implement a `while` loop that:
    - Accepts user input.
    - Appends the user input to a `messages` list.
    - Sends the full `messages` list to the API.
    - Prints the response.
    - **Crucial**: Appends the _response_ to the `messages` list (closing the state loop).
3.  **Exit Condition**: Allow the user to type "exit" or "quit" to break the loop.

**Implementation:**

```python
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from openai import OpenAI

load_dotenv()
client = OpenAI(api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"))

# System persona for Civil Engineering domain
SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are a Senior Civil Engineering Consultant with 20 years of experience in structural design, building codes, and construction management.

Your responses must:
- Use precise technical terminology (e.g., "moment-resisting frame", "shear wall", "bearing capacity")
- Cite relevant building codes (IBC, ASCE 7, ACI 318) when applicable
- Prioritize safety and regulatory compliance above all else
- Be concise but thorough (2-3 paragraphs unless asked for more detail)
- Flag any assumptions you make about project context
- Recommend consulting licensed professionals for critical decisions

If a question is outside structural/civil engineering (e.g., electrical, HVAC), clearly state this is outside your expertise."""

# Initialize conversation with system prompt
messages = [{"role": "system", "content": SYSTEM_PROMPT}]

print("🏗️  Civil Engineering Consultant Chatbot")
print("=" * 50)
print("Ask me about structural design, building codes, or construction.")
print("Type 'exit' or 'quit' to end the conversation.\n")

while True:
    # Get user input
    user_input = input("You: ").strip()

    if user_input.lower() in ["exit", "quit"]:
        print("\n👋 Goodbye! Stay safe and build strong!")
        break

    if not user_input:
        continue

    # Add user message to history
    messages.append({"role": "user", "content": user_input})

    try:
        # Send full conversation history to API
        response = client.chat.completions.create(
            model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
            messages=messages,
            temperature=0.7
        )

        # Extract assistant's reply
        assistant_message = response.choices[0].message.content

        # Print response
        print(f"\n🏗️  Consultant: {assistant_message}\n")

        # CRITICAL: Add assistant message to history
        messages.append({"role": "assistant", "content": assistant_message})

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"\n❌ Error: {e}\n")
        # Remove the user message we just added since we couldn't get a response
        messages.pop()
```

**Verification:**
Run your chatbot.

1.  Ask it: "What are the standard concrete grades for a high-rise foundation?" (Verify technical accuracy and tone).
2.  Then ask: "Can you summarize that list?" (Verify it remembers the previous context).
3.  Ask: "I'm working on a bridge in California. What seismic requirements apply?" (Verify domain expertise).

**Expected behavior:**

- First question: Detailed technical response with code references
- Second question: Summarizes previous response (proves memory works)
- Third question: Caltrans-specific guidance (proves domain knowledge)

## Common Mistakes 🚫

| Mistake                           | Why it happens                       | The Fix                                                                               |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Bot has Amnesia**               | You aren't saving the history.       | Ensure you `.append()` the assistant's reply to your `messages` list.                 |
| **API Key Error**                 | You forgot to load `.env`.           | Make sure `load_dotenv()` is called _before_ you use `os.getenv`.                     |
| **Spending too much**             | Loop went infinite.                  | Always put a `time.sleep()` in automated loops and check your OpenAI usage dashboard. |
| **Two consecutive user messages** | Forgot to append assistant response. | Always append both user AND assistant messages.                                       |
| **Context window exceeded**       | Conversation too long.               | Implement context management (sliding window, summarization).                         |

## Quick Reference Card 🃏

```python
# Standard Import Setup
from openai import OpenAI
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os

load_dotenv()
client = OpenAI(api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"))

# Basic Call
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}],
    temperature=0.7
)
text = response.choices[0].message.content

# Message Roles
# system: Sets personality and constraints
# user: The human input
# assistant: The AI response (for memory)

# Stateful Chatbot Pattern
messages = [{"role": "system", "content": "You are helpful."}]

while True:
    user_input = input("You: ")
    if user_input == "exit":
        break
    
    # 1. Append user message
    messages.append({"role": "user", "content": user_input})
    
    # 2. Get response
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
        messages=messages
    )
    
    # 3. Extract and print
    reply = response.choices[0].message.content
    print(f"AI: {reply}")
    
    # 4. CRITICAL: Append assistant message
    messages.append({"role": "assistant", "content": reply})

# Error Handling Pattern
from openai import RateLimitError, APIConnectionError

try:
    response = client.chat.completions.create(...)
except RateLimitError:
    print("Rate limit hit. Wait and retry.")
except APIConnectionError:
    print("Network error. Check connection.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Unexpected error: {e}")

# Token Cost Estimation
# Input: tokens × $0.01/1K (GPT-3.5) or $0.03/1K (GPT-4)
# Output: tokens × $0.03/1K (GPT-3.5) or $0.06/1K (GPT-4)
# Rule of thumb: 1 token ≈ 0.75 words ≈ 4 characters
```

## Verification (Test Your Knowledge!) 🧪

Let's ensure you've really got this locked down.

**Automated Test Check:**
Create a file `test_connection.py` and run it:

```python
# test_connection.py
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from openai import OpenAI

def test_connection():
    load_dotenv()
    key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
    assert key is not None, "❌ API Key not found in environment!"
    
    client = OpenAI(api_key=key)
    try:
        # Minimal cost test
        response = client.chat.completions.create(
            model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
            messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "hi"}],
            max_tokens=5
        )
        print("✅ OpenAI Connection Verified!")
        print(f"Response: {response.choices[0].message.content}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"❌ Connection Failed: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_connection()
```

**Conceptual Verification:**

Answer these questions to verify your understanding:

1. **Token Economics:**
   - Q: If a document is 10,000 tokens and you ask 20 questions about it (sending the full document each time), how many input tokens do you send?
   - A: 10,000 × 20 = 200,000 tokens

2. **State Management:**
   - Q: If you forget to append the assistant's response to your messages list, what happens?
   - A: The model forgets what it just said. Conversation breaks.

3. **Message Roles:**
   - Q: What's the difference between "system" and "user" roles?
   - A: System sets behavior/constraints. User is the actual input/question.

4. **Error Handling:**
   - Q: What exception is raised when you hit the rate limit?
   - A: `RateLimitError`

5. **Context Window:**
   - Q: What happens if your conversation exceeds the model's context window?
   - A: API returns an error or truncates the input.

**If you can answer all 5 correctly, you're ready for Chapter 8!**

## Summary

We've covered a massive amount of ground today. Let's recap:

1.  **LLM APIs simplify AI**: You don't need to be a math genius; you just need to know how to send a dictionary to a server.
2.  **Tokens are the currency**: Language models think in chunks called tokens, not words. Cost, latency, and context limits all depend on tokens.
3.  **Authentication is critical**: Treat your API key like a credit card. Never hardcode it. Use environment variables.
4.  **State must be managed**: The API has no memory. You must send the full conversation history every time.
5.  **Roles control the flow**: System prompts set the rules; User prompts drive the action; Assistant messages maintain memory.
6.  **Error handling is essential**: APIs fail. Networks drop. Rate limits hit. Handle errors gracefully with specific exception types.
7.  **Token economics matter**: Every token costs money. Design systems that are token-efficient (chunking, caching, smart context management).

**Key Production Patterns:**

- **Stateful Chatbot**: Append both user and assistant messages to maintain conversation
- **Retry Pattern**: Handle rate limits and network failures gracefully
- **Context Management**: Use sliding windows or summarization for long conversations
- **System Prompt Design**: Invest time crafting specific, domain-appropriate prompts
- **Cost Monitoring**: Track token usage and set up alerts

**What You Built:**

- ✅ Your first LLM API call
- ✅ A stateful chatbot with memory
- ✅ Domain-specific assistant (Civil Engineering Consultant)
- ✅ Error handling with retry logic
- ✅ Understanding of token economics

**What's Next?**

Now that you can talk to one model, what happens if that model goes down? Or if you want to swap OpenAI for Anthropic? In **Chapter 8**, we'll build a **Multi-Provider Client** that makes your code bulletproof and vendor-agnostic.

You'll learn to:
- Abstract away provider-specific APIs
- Implement automatic fallback (if OpenAI fails, try Anthropic)
- Compare model performance across providers
- Build a unified interface for all LLMs

**You've taken your first step into a larger world. Welcome to AI Engineering.** 🚀
